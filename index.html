						<!--eventually figure out how to build a modal when clicking on
						"method scholar" to describe what that means
							Define method scholar as someone who dives into a singular interests, obsessing over the details for a pre-determined period of time.
							If it's bee-keeping, every day you think about bees, talk about bees, read about bees, etc. Going to this depth
							allows you to a) more fully understand a new subject matter b) relate to and empathize with others who have that shared passion/interest
							c) forces yourself to focus in a world that's competing for every second of your time
						d) makes you a more interesting person					-->
								<p>I call myself a method scholar (borrowed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" target="_blank">method acting</a>), in that I spend my time immersed
									in a specific discipline or lifestyle for a predetermined period of time.</p>
								<p>In the past few years, you could have caught me running
									product for a small health tech startup, living as an
									itinerary-free vagabond traveling for months on end, day
									trading multi-leg derivatives, reading countless books on
									ancient Stoic philosophy, or in an airport en route to a
									client health system. I've found that this deliberate,
									multi-disciplinary approach to life facilitates authentic,
									solution-oriented thinking and a deep sense of
									understanding-driven empathy.</p>
								<p>In my <a href ="#projects">work</a>, I see through the
									eyes of an idealist but act with the discipline of a
									pragmatist. Barriers become catalysts that empower me to
									solve otherwise unarticulated problems.</p>

									<p>I like working on projects that have a well-defined purpose and a mission worthy of putting countless hours into achieving them.</p>
										<h3>MyMeds</h3>
											<p>My day job is at a health tech startup based in Minneapolis called <a href ="https://www.my-meds.com" target="_blank">MyMeds</a>. Our mission is to improve health outcomes and reduce the overall cost of care by improving medication adherence.
												As Head of Product, I focus my energy at the intersection of our business strategy,
												technical vision, and user experience.</p>
										<h3>The Stoic Fellowship</h3>
											<p>In 2016, I co-founded <a href="https://www.stoicfellowship.com" target="_blank">The Stoic Fellowship</a>, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that seeks to
												build, connect, and foster communities of people interested in an ancient Greek philosophy known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism" target="_blank">Stoicism</a>. To date, we've helped build communities
												in over 50 cities spanning every continent. I serve as President and board member.
										<h3>Fix Broadway</h3>
											<p>There's a 4-lane undivided street in NE Minneapolis called Broadway where the lanes are too narrow, crashes are common, pedestrians fear for their lives, and cyclists who ride it must have a death wish. I'm working with a task force of about
												60 people under the monicker <a href="https://www.fixbroadway.org" target="_blank">Fix Broadway</a> to create improvements. We've surveyed thousands of residents and commuters, met with city and county officials to discuss concerns, and are now in the process of designing solutions.
											</p>
										<h3>Compass Foundry</h3>
											<p>I founded <a href="https://www.compassfoundry.com" target="_blank">Compass Foundry</a> with a desire to help non-technical founders bootstrap a profitable tech business with as little resistance as possible. The M.O. for most non-technical founders today is to either hire a dev shop to build an unvetted idea for $100K+ and then realize that their idea was shit
												and nobody wants it, or they give away half their equity up front to hire a technical co-founder who may or may not share their passion for the idea. I figured there had to be a better way. Compass Foundry offers non-technical founders the ability to apply for a program in which technical and product design experts help build an idea for zero up front costs in exchange for
												a revenue sharing agreement after achieving profitability. This perfectly aligns incentives, as we don't take a cent until the non-technical founder is making money themselves.
											</p>

									<h2>Past Projects</h2>
								</br>
										<h3>Accel.MN</h3>
											<p>Accel.MN was a totally free program for entrepreneurs to refine their ideas and be prompted into action in a collaborative setting. It was like a "pre-accelerator", or a program that would prepare people for a more traditional accelerator seeking to invest seed funding in exchange for equity in a startup.
												The mission of Accel.MN was to accelerate the entrepreneurial ecosystem of Minnesota by improving the collective education, network, and support of early-stage entrepreneurs while promoting a positive startup culture. In addition to participating in the first cohort, I served as a founding board member.
										<h3>North Labs</h3>
											<p>I co-founded <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/15245045/" target="_blank">North Labs</a> in 2016 with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/collingraves" target="_blank">Collin Graves</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/motterstatter" target="_blank">Matt Otterstatter</a>.
												Our mission was simple: provide non-technical founders with software development resources at a fraction of the cost that agencies and freelancers charge in today's market. To do this, I built relationships with over a dozen fully-vetted offshore firms while offering product
											management and technical architecture in-house. As with many of the companies we advised, North Labs pivoted in late 2017 to meet more lucrative demands with AWS consulting. With the pivot (and admittedly my lack of AWS knowledge), I decided to sell my ownership in North Labs and pursue new projects.</p>
										<h3>Eat and Greet</h3>
											<p>Eat and Greet flipped the traditional restaurant experience on its head. People generally go to restaurants with friends, family, or colleagues. With Eat and Greet, six individuals RSVPed to save a seat at a table ahead of time and left with a full belly and five new friends.
													These experiences were great for people who were new to a city and wanted to make new connections while trying local restaurants. The idea was in MVP stage as I tested concepts with a Meetup community. If successful, I planned to build it into a full product with the mission of connecting people hungry for food, friendship, and thought-provoking conversation.
											</p>
										<h3>MNonFIRE</h3>
											<p>MNonFIRE was a community I founded for people who aspire to FIRE, or become financially independent and retire early. The FIRE movement is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/style/fire-financial-independence-retire-early.html" target="_blank">picking up traction</a> across the
													nation, and I wanted to create a forum for people to meet in real life and share resources and insights. Core to this ethos is that our time is the most precious finite resource. Thus we do everything we can to create a life for ourselves in which we have the freedom to choose how we spend that time, even if that means attaining a 50%+ or greater savings rate by
													living significantly below our means.
											</p>
										<h3>Stoic Daily</h3>
											<p>I launched a micro tech project with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zfoster45" target="_blank">Zach Foster</a>,
												my close friend and travel buddy. <a href= "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stoic-new-tab/egflmnkcgdbljjogbonkpahhaddkgcgp?hl=en" target="_blank">Stoic Daily</a> is a Chrome extension that changes "new tabs" into beautiful natural settings overlayed by a quote from a Stoic author.

						<!-- Travel -->

								<h2 class="major">Travel</h2>
							<!--	<span class="image main"><img src="" alt="" /></span> -->
								<p>I've found long-term travel to be an efficient promoter of rapid self-improvement.
								It's helped me identify and correct bad habits, priorize life goals, and more fully
							 	empathize with people of backgrounds radically different from my own.
								<h3>Long-Term Trips</h3>
									<ul>
										<li><h4>Ireland in Summer 2009</h4></li>
											<p>I studied Irish film at Trinity College in Dublin during a two-month summer term.
										<li><h4>Central America in 2011 and 2014</h4></li>
											<p>I backpacked down the Pacific coast of Costa Rica with long-time friend and might-as-well-be brother, <a href="http://mattmomont.com/" target="_blank">Matt Momont</a>.
												In 2014, I took my parents on a surprise adventure through Panama.
										<li><h4>Europe in 2014</h4></li>
											<p>I traveled to over 20 countries in Europe over the course of four months with my closest and most cherished friend from college, <a href="https://twitter.com/notzachfoster" target="_blank">Zach Foster</a>.
											<p>Cities Visited: Dublin, Madrid, Barcelona, Nice, Florence, Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, Krakow,
												Prague, Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zadar, Dubrovnik,

								Once I've removed myself from everything external that contributes to my identity,
								I'm forced to honestly examine who I am and who I want to become. And what's more,
								I'm forced to do so without the pressures of family, friends, and my community telling
								me who I should be or what I should want. Instead, it's just me and a million strangers
								who couldn't care less about who I am, where I've come from, or what I've done.
								It's in those moments that I've realized that I am my own judge and the maker of my life.-->

		<!--And while liberating, it's terrifying when
		don't know how to define their own success in life. Happiness isn't something worth striving toward. It's an effect that comes from flourishing in the areas
	in life that matter to you. But until you've spent enough time figuring out what's important to you, you won't know how to spend your time and thus will likely
spend what little of it you have wrong. So one of my goals is not to preach the life-changing benefits of long-term world travel. It's to provide a roadmap for
how you can do the same - if you find the open road calling your name.</p> -->
